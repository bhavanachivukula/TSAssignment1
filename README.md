Problem Context 
It's the finals of the T20 Cup! Bengaluru and Chennai, neighbours and fierce rivals, are 
fighting it out for the title. Bengaluru's star batsman Kirat is at the crease. Can he win it for 
Bengaluru? Write code to simulate the last 4 overs of the match. 
 
It's the last 4 overs of the match. Bengaluru needs 40 runs to win and with 4 wickets left. Each 
player has a different probability for scoring runs. Your coding problem is to simulate the match, 
ball by ball. The match simulation will require you to use a weighted random number generation 
based on probability to determine the runs scored per ball. 

Rules of the game: 
● Batsmen change strike end of every over. They also change strike when they score a 
1,3 or 5 
● When a player gets out, the new player comes in at the same position.  
● Assume only legal balls are bowled (no wides, no no-balls etc..). Therefore an over is 
always 6 balls.  
 
Sample Output 
 
Bengaluru won by 1 wicket and 2 balls remaining 
 
Kirat Boli - 12 (6 balls)  
NS Nodhi - 25 (11 balls)  
R Rumrah - 2* (3 balls)  
Shashi Henra - 2* (2 balls)
